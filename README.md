# algebra-stuff

Includes two independent projects:
- a Python module for handling polynomial rings, modules and homomorphism spaces between modules (cf. directory [algebra stuff](https://github.com/maschull106/algebra-stuff/tree/main/algebra_stuff)),
- a Macaulay2 package for operations with double nested Quot schemes and associated tangent spaces (cf. directory [macaulay2 stuff](https://github.com/maschull106/algebra-stuff/tree/main/macaulay2_stuff)).



<!-- Python library for handling polynomial rings, modules and homorphism spaces between modules.\
Specifically applied to computations on Hilbert schemes of points and nested Hilbert schemes of points.\
See [demo notebook](https://github.com/maschull106/algebra-stuff/blob/main/demo.ipynb) for a walkthrough. -->
